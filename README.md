# React Shopping List!

This is a full-stack react shopping list!
This app will help you keep track of items you plan to buy  and how much you plan to purchase of each one. 

## Description

At the top of the page you can add an item `name`, the `quantity` in which you plan to buy and the `unit` of measurement. Once you save an item to your list it will appear on the DOM with the option to `Buy` or `Remove` from your list. Once bought, the item will appear as `Purchased`, if `removed` is clicked the item will be deleted and removed from your shopping list. At the top of your shopping list there is a `reset` button that will revert any purchased items back to before they were purchased. The `clear` button will remove all items from the shopping list.
